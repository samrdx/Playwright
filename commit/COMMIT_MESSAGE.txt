Fix: robustSelect guard and resilience for crear_viaje_corrected.spec.ts

- Add page.isClosed() guard in robustSelect to avoid exceptions when the page/context is closed in CI.
- Wrap waitForTimeout calls to avoid "Target page, context or browser has been closed" errors.
- Improve select and modal handling: safer selectpicker fallback and retries for agrega ruta flow.
- Add debug logs and screenshots for troubleshooting in Playwright runs.
